Description: 
---
  A customized Pomodoro timer made using Python Tkinter. This python application is programmed to appear on top of the screen whenever the timer transitions within its 3 intervals:
  (working, short break, and long break). There are Kirby images that were made using Photoshop to change with the intervals to make the transitions more apparent.
  There is a symbol at the bottom to keep track of how many working (25-minute) intervals one has been able to complete. The reset button removes these and starts the first 25:00
  timer once again.
